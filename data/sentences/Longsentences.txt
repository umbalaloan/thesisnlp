019_As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[citation needed] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform
020_The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them
021_The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences
022_As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License
023_ Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets)

033_J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications
034_ In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively
035_In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process
036_At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status
037_Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System
